KCET Rank Prediction and College Recommendation System
Project Overview
This project presents a robust machine learning solution to predict KCET (Karnataka Common Entrance Test) ranks based on marks and provide personalized college recommendations. The system aids students in estimating their competitive rank prior to official results and assists in selecting suitable colleges based on predicted ranks and branch preferences. It leverages comprehensive official datasets, advanced regression models, and an intuitive web interface deployed via Streamlit.

Dataset Acquisition and Preparation
Sources: Official KCET datasets were gathered from the KEA website for the years 2023, 2024, and 2025, capturing marks, ranks, and related student performance data.

Data Cleaning: The most challenging aspect involved converting raw data from diverse formats into unified Excel files, handling missing values, ensuring consistency across years, and normalizing columns.

Integration: The cleaned datasets were merged to build a comprehensive data foundation for accurate modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Performed in-depth data visualization and analysis including:

Distribution plots to understand marks and rank spread.

Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between features.

Statistical summaries highlighting data quality and potential biases.

Machine Learning Methodology
Models and Hyperparameter Tuning
Implemented and compared several state-of-the-art regression models using rigorous hyperparameter tuning via Randomized Search CV with cross-validation:

Model	Best Performance (R²)	RMSE	Key Hyperparameters Example
Gradient Boosting	0.9996	1169.60	subsample=0.8, n_estimators=500
Random Forest	0.9996	1170.07	n_estimators=100, max_depth=30
Decision Tree	0.9996	1170.01	min_samples_split=8, max_depth=40
Extra Trees	0.9994	1345.15	n_estimators=100, max_depth=50
Ridge Regression	0.9214	15872.43	alpha=0.01, solver='lsqr'
Gradient Boosting emerged as the best performing model based on R² and RMSE.

Regularized linear models provided strong baselines, confirming the non-linear models’ superior fit.

Evaluation Metrics
R² Score: Coefficient of determination measuring explained variance.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Average prediction error magnitude in rank units.
